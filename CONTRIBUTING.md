============

Contributions are welcome, and are accepted via pull requests. Please review these guidelines before submitting any pull requests.

## Guidelines

* Please follow the [PSR-2 Coding Style Guide](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/), enforced by [PHP CS Fixer](http://cs.symfony.com).
* Ensure that the current tests pass, and if you've added something new, add the tests where relevant.
* You may need to [rebase](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing) to avoid merge conflicts.
* If you are changing the behavior, or the public api, you may need to update the docs.
* Please remember that we follow [SemVer](http://semver.org/).

We have [PHP CS Fixer](http://cs.symfony.com) setup to automatically fix any code style issues.
